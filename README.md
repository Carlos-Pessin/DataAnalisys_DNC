A company in the e-commerce sector has hired you to calculate the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) indicators of its customers. Here's what RFM means:

*   R (Recency): The number of days since the customer made their last purchase.
*   F (Frequency): The total number of purchases made by the customer.
*   M (Monetary): The average amount spent per order by the customer.
Where the average amount spent is calculated as the average of the total amount spent per order for each customer.

Besides that, they want to see:
*   Top 10 countries with the highest sales value
*   Top 10 best-selling products
*   Total sales value per month
*   Total sales value per month and per country (consider only the top 10 countries)
